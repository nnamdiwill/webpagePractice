<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>We sincerely believe that basic HTML knowledge is essential to designing
, building, and maintaining readable and workable Web pages. Our goal in this book is to explain what HTML,
XHTML, and CSS are and how they work,and then to show you exactly how to use them to best advantage.</p>

<p>Along the way, we will examine the principles and best practices that govern Web page design and construction, and help you
understand how to make your content accessible to the broadest possible audience. </p>

<p> By the time you work your way through this book's contents, you should feel comfortable with creating and managing your own
Web site. You should also understand what it takes to identify your audience, communicate with that audience, and keep your content 
fresh and interesting to keep them coming back for more. </p>
